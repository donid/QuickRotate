QuickRotate is a small utility that shows an icon in the taskbar notification area (system tray) of
Windows.

It was created for portable devices with a touch screen that have an unreliable
rotation / orientation sensor which can be quite annoying. To activate it, just touch
(left-click) the icon and the choose the rotation angle.

QuickRotate does not require any installation / setup - just run the .exe
 
This project also provides the class library *RotateDisplayLib* which can be used in
PowerShell scripts or in your own .Net application.
